This project has created a labeled MRI brain tumor dataset for the detection of three tumor types: pituitary, meningioma, and glioma. The dataset contains 2443 total images, which have been split into training, validation, and test sets. The training set has 1695 images, the validation set has 502 images, and the test set has 246 images.

**Data:**
* Number of images: 2443
* Image types: MRI scans

**Classes:**
* Pituitary tumor
* Meningioma tumor
* Glioma tumor
* No Tumor

**Split:**
* Training set: 1695 images
* Validation set: 502 images
* Test set: 246 images

**Labeling:**
* The images have been labeled by medical experts using a standardized labeling protocol.
* The labels include the type of tumor and the location of the tumor.

**Potential Applications:**
* This dataset can be used to train machine learning models to automatically classify brain tumors.
* The models could be used to assist radiologists in diagnosing brain tumors.
* The dataset could also be used to develop new treatments for brain tumors.
